    <h1>Hi, I'm Serhiy. </h1>

    <p>After a few years in accounting and finance, I have decided that software industry is where I want to be, so I took a part-time software quality assurance course that was taught by industry veteran Bryan Rowlands in Redmond, WA. I successfully completed the QA101 in April of 2019. It  further increased my interest in software development so I enrolled in full-time programming course at Epodicodus in Seattle, WA. I expect to complete the course and a five-week long internship at the end of November 2019.  </p>
